# Form Design

A Pen created on CodePen.io. Original URL: [https://codepen.io/Timurtek/pen/mdYOGv](https://codepen.io/Timurtek/pen/mdYOGv).

This is a great space saver when it comes to showing the input labels as a placeholder and when user focuses on the input area, it still enables user to enter their information and also placeholder/label is still available for user to see at any time. I just used a login page as an example. For larger forms, this technique would be great to save space.
