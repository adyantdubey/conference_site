    <header>The Short Story Challenge</header>
    <article>
The Short Story Challenge is the same as the Paperback Challenge with only a few differences consisting of:
      <p>
        The Short stories will be found easily on a electronic reading device such as Amazon Kindle
      </p>
      <p>
        And in most cases the reader might not recognise the authors in question, as many of the Short Story writing greats are not as mainstream as the more popular novel writers the reader is used to
      </p>
      <p>
        Also the Short Story World seems to be a dying craft which the Web developer/Authors of this website are eager to encourage a welcomed return.
